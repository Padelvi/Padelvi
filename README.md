- Hi, I’m @Padelvi.
- I’m interested in making APIs, desktop apps, CLIs and TUIs with Python and Rust.
- I am currently learning Rust.
- I know a lot of Python, but I also know Lua a bit.
- I have used linux for a long time. After a lot of distro-hopping, I'm staying in arch.
- At least for now, I do programming just for fun.
